# Star Wars

# How to install game and use?

1. First, clone the repository
   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/SobhanVaziri/Star-wars.git
   ```
2. Then open the `cmd` terminal in the `star wars` file and run this command
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. After installing the requirements, in the Star-wars directory, open the cmd terminal<br>
   and run this command:
   ```cmd
   python main.py
   ```
- __Be careful!!__<br>
  Because if the fireballs hit your ROCKET, __you will lose__<br>
  And the game starts from the beginning :)<br>
  Then use the __left__ and __right__ buttons to move the __ROCKET__
